# Introduction to C++
2023 is the newest version. 
There are many languages newer than C++, but it is still one of the most efficient languages.
There are two things needed to learn: C++ language(syntax & grammar) & libraries(data structures and algorithms).

Popular IDE (integrated development environment): VS, XCode, CLion

First C++ program: HelloWorld
```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```
Compile and run: C++ code need to be compile to machine code first, which is different from system to system. It prints "Hello World" to the screen.

Basics
1. Variables and constants
2. naming converntions
3. mathematical expressions
4. writing to and reading from the console
5. working with the standard library
6. commenâ€ s

### Variables
`int file_size;` is a integer variable declariation, remember to always use meaningful names
`file_size = 100;` assigning the value 100 to this variable.
`int file_size = 100;` combines the above two.
`int file_size = 100, counter = 0;` is declaring and initializing two variables in one line, this is usually discouraged. 

### Constants
`const double pi = 3.14;`, the value of this variable cannot be changed, will error if trying. 

### Naming Conventions
1. Snake case `file_size`, use lower case letters and seperate words with underscore. Or 
2. Pascal case `FileSize`, capitalize the first letter of every word
3. Camel case`fileSize`, capital lize the first letter of every word, except the first one. 
4. Hungarian Notation `iFileSize`, `i` specifies the variable type, which is integer.

### Mathemetical Expression
```
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 3;
    int z = x + y;
    std::cout << z;
    return 0;
}
```
`\` devision, `x/y` will give an integer, gives double when one of the operands is double. 
`%`, `-`, `*` same as other languages. `x++` increment, `x--` decrement. 

```
int x = 10;
int y = x++; // y will be 10, x will be 11.
```

```
int x = 10;
int y = ++x; // x will be 11, y will be 11.
```
